    <markdownProperty name="text" category="details"><![CDATA[For the graphic files, it was decided to convert them to base64 and insert them into the HTML itself. Regarding the style sheets, the possibility of including it with the style tag was considered, which was completely discarded since by introducing all the styles in the tag it exceeded the style limit that the browser can process from style tags. Stylesheets stayed as external resources, javascript scripts were included using *script* tag.

This solution led to three main problems that affect user experience:

- Base64 images increase the HTML file size significantly. This affects **QWebEngine** performance increasing loading times (Browser load event not DOM content loaded event).
- Base64 conversion increase the XSLT render process dramatically. Single image need around 20 ms.
- HTML resource management is unconvenient if styles, javascript and images are embedded.]]></markdownProperty>
