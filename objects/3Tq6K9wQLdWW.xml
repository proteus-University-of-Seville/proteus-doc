    <markdownProperty name="text" category="details"><![CDATA[It was implement as a singleton and placed in the application layer. It is instantiated separately from everything else when the application boots in `app.py` and the controller is provided as dependency. The clipboard uses the state manager and the controller so it can be completely independent from any other resource when performing cut/copy/paste operations. This makes possible calling these clipboard methods from anywhere in the application.

It provides methods to check whether cut/copy/paste are available (based on the current object). Context menu actions are enable/disabled when the menu is created, the main menu buttons are update when the select object event is triggered.

Cut/paste is performed like a change object position operation. Copy/paste is performed like a clone operation. Both operations have their respective limitations. The difference is that and object can be clone into its parent (copy/paste) but it cannot be moved to its parent because it is already its child (cut/paste).]]></markdownProperty>
