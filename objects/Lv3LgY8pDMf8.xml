Some base events were defined as a result of basic user interactions (open project, delete object, etc). PyQt events or "signals" are no longer connected directly to the update methods of each component, these now trigger one or more events as appropriate. It is the responsibility of each component to subscribe one or more methods to one or more events.]]></markdownProperty>
